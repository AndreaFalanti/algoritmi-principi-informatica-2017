Algoritmi e principi dell'informatica (2017) course project exam.

The project consists in implementing a non-deterministic Turing machine using C language, using only standard libraries.
The final goal of the project was not only its correctness on multiple input files, but also the optimization of the entire procedure, since it was required to pass a sequence of automatic tests under some time and memory constraints.

More details in the pdf (italian only).
